  abstract = {Directed graph and multinomial error models were used to assess and characterize the error statistics in all published large-scale datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Using a directed graph model for bait to prey systems and a multinomial error model, we assessed the error statistics in all published large-scale datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized them by three traits: the set of tested interactions, artifacts that lead to false-positive or false-negative observations, and estimates of the stochastic error rates that affect the data. These traits provide a prerequisite for the estimation of the protein interactome and its modules.},

  abstract = {Thousands of interactions assemble proteins into modules that impart spatial and functional organization to the cellular proteome. Through affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we have created two proteome-scale, cell-line-specific interaction networks. The first, BioPlex 3.0, results from affinity purification of 10,128 human proteins-half the proteome-in 293T cells and includes 118,162 interactions among 14,586 proteins. The second results from 5,522 immunoprecipitations in HCT116 cells. These networks model the interactome whose structure encodes protein function, localization, and complex membership. Comparison across cell lines validates thousands of interactions and reveals extensive customization. Whereas shared interactions reside in core complexes and involve essential proteins, cell-specific interactions link these complexes, "rewiring" subnetworks within each cell's interactome. Interactions covary among proteins of shared function as the proteome remodels to produce each cell's phenotype. Viewable interactively online through BioPlexExplorer, these networks define principles of proteome organization and enable unknown protein characterization.},
